            &nbsp;&nbsp;«U SAVE UKRAINE» Foundation (USU) is a 501(c)3
            non-governmental organization based in New Jersey, USA that supports
            Ukraine in its development of democracy, a free market economy,
            human rights, and a strategic partnership with the United States.
            Foundation was established after Russia's full-scale invasion to
            Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Maintaining a continuous presence in
            Kyiv since our founding in 2022, USU has quickly adapted and
            expanded our humanitarian assistance capabilities. Our extensive
            network of partners allows us to understand and address the pressing
            needs and challenges in Ukraine. Delivering humanitarian aid,
            helping trusted local organizations, and advocating effective
            Western support are central to our work to create a strong and
            prosperous future for Ukraine. Our success has been made possible by
            sponsors and partnerships with a wide range of individuals and
            organizations in the US, Ukraine and around the world.
